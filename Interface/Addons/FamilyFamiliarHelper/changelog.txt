- toc update for 10.0.2 patch

10/25/2022 version 2.0.1
- Update for Dragonflight clients

10/09/2022 version 2.0.0
- To allow for future growth and to allow localized names for achievements, the tabs across the bottom are replaced with a separate "home" panel that has a list of family familiar achievements to choose from. Clicking into one of these will bring you to the progress for that achievement. Clicking the Back button in the progress panel will take you back to the list of achievements again.
- Settings have been moved to their own options panel in the default options interface panel. (Esc to game menu then Interface->AddOns (Shadowlands) or Options->AddOns (Dragonflight))
- The Lock Window option has been split into two options: 'Don't dismiss window with Escape key' and 'Don't move window unless Shift held'
- Added option 'Hide achievement list tooltips' to hide the tooltip for the top-level family familiar achievements.
- When the 'Automatically show on achievement targets' option is enabled, the window will not show if the achievement associated with the target has already been completed or if all criteria that matches the target's name is completed. If a criteria doesn't match a target's name, such as Addius the Tormenter/Tormentor, then this behavior will not kick in for that target and the window will be shown.
- Criteria tooltips have a solid dark color again so they're easier to read against the busy backgrounds.
- The tables to update for future expansions' achievements was reorganized and moved to AchievementInfo.lua.
- Family Familiar of Dragon Isles achievement and criteria added (Thanks Flohsakk!) for Dragonflight clients.
- Beta/PTR users will need to load out of date addons for this to work until the update for the Dragonflight pre-patch.

- toc update for 7.3 patch

- Updated for 7.3 patch and the new Family Fighter achievement.
- While on the 7.3 client, two tabs will appear at the bottom of the window to switch between Family Familiar and Family Fighter.
- The green checks marking an achievement complete is now based on the achievement's completion status and not how many sub-achievements were finished. This should only be noticable by 7.3 PTR users: The PTR character copy seemed to copy the Family Familiar achievement but not the sub-achievements. So you may see green checks for totals while all pet types are blank. This is normal and should not happen on live servers.
