This addon's purpose is to make it easier to see at a glance which pet family has not been used for each tamer for the Family Familiar and related battle pet achievements.

For instance the original Family Familiar achievement asks that you complete the following:

Aquatic Acquiescence: Defeat 12 Master Tamers in Broken Isles with all Aquatic pets.
Best of the Beasts: Defeat 12 Master Tamers in Broken Isles with all Beast pets.
Mousing Around: Defeat 12 Master Tamers in Broken Isles with all Critter pets.
Dragons!: Defeat 12 Master Tamers in Broken Isles with all Dragonkin pets.
Ragnaros, Watch and Learn: Defeat 12 Master Tamers in Broken Isles with all Elemental pets.
Flock Together: Defeat 12 Master Tamers in Broken Isles with all Flying pets.
Murlocs, Harpies, and Wolvar, Oh My!: Defeat 12 Master Tamers in Broken Isles with all Humanoid pets.
Master of Magic: Defeat 12 Master Tamers in Broken Isles with all Magic pets.
Roboteer: Defeat 12 Master Tamers in Broken Isles with all Mechanical pets.
The Lil' Necromancer: Defeat 12 Master Tamers in Broken Isles with all Undead pets.

If you're keeping score that's 120 battles for this achievement. As of Dragonflight to get all six achievements you need to win 720 battles. This addon should make it easier to get there.

How To Use:

The default behavior of this addon is to summon its window when you target one of the candidates that qualify for one of the achievements.

If you'd prefer to summon the window manually, you can turn off the automatic summoning by going into options (ESC to game menu -> Interface (Options on Dragonflight) -> AddOns) and unchecking 'Automatically show window on achievement targets'. There are a few other options there as well.

You can also summon the window with the /ffh macro command or by setting up a key binding in the key binding interface.

When first opened, you'll be presented with a list of achievements and your progress in each. Click one to open up a progress panel with a grid of the criteria and pet types completed so far.

Along the bottom of the progress panel are the total battles won with each pet family. Each achievement is different, but you'll know you've gotten sufficient wins when each pet type has a green check at the bottom. You can mouseover these totals to get a more familiar view of the achievement's progress.
