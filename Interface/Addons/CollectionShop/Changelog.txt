**4.02**

- Release date: 05/09/2020

**4.01**

- Release date: 05/09/2020
- Bug fixed: Battle Pet searches where a lower quality pet was cheapest but a higher quality was available was resulting in CollectionShop saying the auction was unavailable. This was because Blizzard's quality filters are somewhat broken for Battle Pets as the filter only works when selecting the highest quality the pet is available as. Workaround has been implemented.

**2.01**

- Bug fixed: In some cases not all Sources were being gathered to determine if an Appearance was collected (API inconsistencies) and may have returned Collected items as being Not Collected.
- Bug fixed: Rarely a noticable effect but in the event an Appearance Shop was performed within a few seconds of login or reload the number of results may have been reduced. The internal timeout has been increased for checking Sources to compensate for the game's info lag during that time.
- Live checkbox now disabled while scanning to prevent accidental cancellation of a GetAll scan.

**2.0**

- Release date: 07/16/2017
- Time since last scan will now show "Live" in green when the Live checkbox is checked instead of showing the last time a GetAll scan was performed.
- Around 20% less auctions are stored for comparison during scanning. They are simply not needed because they are not a Mount, Pet, Toy, or Appearance.
- Around 10% more results will be shown in an Appearance mode Shop. This is due to no longer restricting Sources by type and also the inclusion of hidden Sources that Blizzard deems unobtainable or otherwise chooses to hide.
- Appearances mode no longer immediately starts updating when choosing a mode. A faster modified updating from your collection is performed during Shop once after each GetAll scan or every time you perform a Live scan.
- Added Mounts portrait to Options frame.
- The change mode button (top left on AH tab) is now disabled while scanning to prevent accidental cancellation of a GetAll scan.

**1.02**

- Bug fixed: Rare Lua error on slow connections caused by previous increase in filter retry attempts.
- Bug fixed: Sometimes on slow connections, auctions were said to be no longer available when really there was just not enough time given to find the information required. Increased retry attempts to compensate, this should no longer happen.

**1.01**

- Release date: 09/07/2016
- Bug fixed: Occasionally items Already known would be listed as Not Collected due to slow response in retrieving item information. I've increased retry attempts to retrieve item information for filters to avoid inaccurate results. Should an item still fail during filtering a chat message will be shown.
