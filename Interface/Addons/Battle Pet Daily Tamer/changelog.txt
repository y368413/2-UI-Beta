- Paws will less aggressively try to be the top-most icon when other icons share the same space.
- The "Completed Dailies" option was renamed to "Inactive Dailies" and shows greyed-out paws for quests that are either completed and unavailable.
- Inactive Dailies do not show on the Azeroth world map. (Otherwise the Broken Isle is a near-solid cluster of grey paws.)
- Turning on/off the Pet Battles world map tracking option will now use the default's cvar instead of an independant savedvariable.
- The "Pet Reward Dailies" option is renamed to "Reward Dailies" but otherwise behaves the same.
