	dailyInfo describes all dailies. It's indexed by the questID of each daily quest.

	[questID] = {
		[1] = tamer numeric npcID or name of event like "Celestial Tournament"
		[2] = text about daily ("Darkmoon Faire", "Beasts of Fable Book II", etc)
		[3] = parentMapID (the mapID of the "continent" the questIDs are grouped under)
		[4] = instanceID (the fourth return of UnitPosition; though continent-wide ones are okay too)
		[5] = worldY continent-level y coordinate (first return of UnitPosition)
		[6] = worldX continent-level x coordinate (second return of UnitPosition)

		[11] = level of pets for this tamer (1-25)
		[12] = speciesID of tamer's first pet
		[13] = speciesID of tamer's second pet
		[14] = speciesID of tamer's third pet
	}

	Notes:
		When a questID is Number1:Number2, Number1 is the questID and Number2 is the objective number.
		When a questID is Alliance|Horde:Number1, Number1 is a questID shared by both factions. (Only one faction's
			version of those quests survives removal of faction-specific quests; the index will become a number)
		When a questID is always:npcID this is a quest that should always be visible and has no related questID.
		If mapX and mapY are ever removed, keep mapID. It's used to prevent pins underneath world quest pins.
		Any dailyInfo with a **NEEDS PETS** comment needs its speciesID populated

	parentMapIDs is a lookup table to control the grouping of quests.

	and Argus' three zones share an instanceID but the worldPos has problems mapping a worldPos
	to a sibling zone.

	parent chain until it hits one of the mapIDs in this table. All quests in dailyInfo that
	have this parentMapID are in the same "continent" and can be handled together.

	Any new parentMapID added in dailyInfo MUST be added to this table as well.
